# Crypt Text 

This is a simple Python program that demonstrates the Caesar Cipher encryption and decryption algorithm. The Caesar Cipher is a type of substitution cipher in which each letter in the plaintext is shifted a certain number of places down or up the alphabet.

## Features

- Encrypts and decrypts messages using the Caesar Cipher algorithm.
- Allows the user to input the message and the shift value.
- Handles both uppercase and lowercase letters.
- Leaves non-alphabetic characters unchanged.

## How to Use

1. Clone the repository:
   ```
   https://github.com/aiwin2002/PRODIGY_CS_1.git
   ```

2. Navigate into the project directory:
   ```
   cd PRODIGY_CS_1
   ```

3. Run the program:
   ```
   python3 PRODIGY_CS_1.py
   ```

##Follow the prompts to encrypt or decrypt a message.


1. Choose whether you want to encrypt or decrypt a message by typing 'e' or 'd'.
2. Enter the message you want to encrypt or decrypt.
3. Enter the shift value (an integer).
4. The program will display the encrypted or decrypted result.
5. You can choose to perform another encryption or decryption or exit the program.

## Example

Welcome to the Caesar Cipher program!
Would you like to (e)ncrypt or (d)ecrypt a message? (e/d): e
Enter your message: Hello, World!
Enter the shift value: 3
Result: Khoor, Zruog!
Would you like to encrypt/decrypt another message? (y/n): n
Goodbye!
